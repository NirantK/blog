A failure resume is, as its name suggests, a list of rejections and setbacks. 

This concept originated in [academia](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html), but can be applied to improve one’s career, resilience, and approach to challenges in any walk of life.

I’ve organized my setbacks by year (starting with 2016), and what constitutes a “failure” here is based solely on my own judgement. 
It’s important to not only list the failures, but also learn from them, so I will add reflections to some of them (in progress). 
This isn’t an exhaustive list.

# 2019
- Spent 6 weeks prototyping a solution at Verloop.io which doesn't break even on cost
  - Lesson Learnt: In Enterprise SaaS, never write any code before someone tells you what they are willing to pay for that

# 2018
- Did not even get interview callbacks from my favourite NLP Company at the time: [Rasa](https://rasa.com/)
- Had to quit Soroco because of lack of opportunities to grow internally. Really loved the crew, which was smart but not agile or humble
- Did not even apply to GoJek, Linkedin and Swiggy's kickass Data Science teams
  - Lesson learnt: Be proactive. Take moonshots. Setting an upper-cap on your ambitions is kinda stupid

# 2016
