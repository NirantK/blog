# Who is this for?
This is written for me, 5 years ago - when I was starting my career in Data Science. You can treat these Notes or Advice or Opinion.

Circa 2015, Data Science was still poorly understood in India. The most respected job in my immediate techie friend circle was actually a backend dev job at Directi, Google or Tower Capital. 

I also have the unique experience of having tried competitive programming in earnest and outright giving up. I still dread algorithmic interviewing. For a profession that takes pride in innovation, I find the emphasis of software engineers on  algorithmic interviewing a bit insane. 


It's almost like we've tried everything else and fallen short. In fact, it's quite the opposite - we've tried everything else, and almost everything else works better than algorithmic interviewing. 

# Academia

## Do I need a MS/PhD?
Almost definitely, yes.

Now before you get all antsy and get up on my arse, let me tell you this upfront: The value of MS/PhD is not at all in the training or what you learn. 

It's valuable because I can justify it to my boss if I hire a PhD and they screw up, it's the best anyone could've done.

# Bits of Both Worlds

# Early Specialization as Competitive Advantage

## Career Journey Examples

# Learning Medium Agility

## The Levels

The Beginner: Basic math, usually undergrad level calculus and stats. Basic programming skills, but not ML specific. Often people coming backend development / software engineering roles

Tools: Learning the basic tools in R/Python, loading data of various types, reading data, plotting data

Communication: Learn to interpret results of algorithms/models, being able to talk to engineers, other ML folk and business. Explaining how to make figures. How to tell a story. When and what dataviz to use. Connect model metrics like AUC to impact metrics like revenue

Real data: Manipulating different file formats, working with “messy” data, trying to organize multiple data sets into one data set, pivots and joins know-how. Data Modeling skills. Several analysts and Kagglers are here

Supervised Projects: Work through from start to finish but with help and supervision, can clean easy data sets, but need a clear path from the beginning of the problem to the end scope/solution

Problem Formulation: How to define a question, how to turn a question into a statement about data, how to identify data sets that may be applicable, experimental design, critical thinking about data sets

Just the question: Here is a problem. Figure out a dataset, evaluation metric, when to quit, what counts as success and how to ship

The Novice: You can come up with your own questions and answer them using data and ship ML models
