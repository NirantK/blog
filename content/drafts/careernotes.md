# Who is this for?

This is written for me, 5 years ago - when I was starting my career in Data Science. You can treat these as Notes/Advice/Rant/Opinion.

That said, I expect this to be helpful to:

* Early to Mid Career Folks in Engineering roles considering moving to ML/Data Science

* Primarily written for those in India
    * _Rant_: If you're not in India and any of this applies to you, please consider hiring a career coach - you've too much low hanging fruit in planning your career 

_Rant_: Note that the most obnoxious, random comments will be marked by _Rant_. 

<!-- ## My Biases

Circa 2015, Data Science was still poorly understood in India. The most respected job in my immediate techie friend circle was actually a backend dev job at Directi, Google or Tower Capital. 

I also tried competitive programming in earnest and outright gave up. I still dread algorithmic interviewing. For a profession that takes pride in innovation, I find the emphasis of software engineers _solely_ on algorithmic interviewing a bit insane. 

It's almost like we've tried everything else and fallen short. In fact, it's quite the opposite - we've tried everything else, and almost everything else works better than algorithmic interviewing.  -->

# Academia

## Do I need a MS/PhD from a Foreign University?
Almost definitely, yes.

Here are my reasons:

0. You get a Work VISA
- If I were making my career choices again, I'd consider moving out of India the first chance I get.

- Why? The competition within India for ML roles is extremely high

- Why? Backend Software Engineering salaries have basically been meeting/barely beating inflation for the last 10 years. 

- So What?

Getting a foreign MS/PhD will make it easier and cheaper for you to stand out for the rest of your career. 

# Industry

3 levels: Junior, Senior, Principal: In an industry track - https://towardsdatascience.com/becoming-a-level-3-0-data-scientist-52641ff73cb3

# Bits of Both Worlds

# Early Specialization as Competitive Advantage

## Career Journey Examples

# Learning Medium Agility

## The Levels

The Beginner: Basic math, usually undergrad level calculus and stats. Basic programming skills, but not ML specific. Often people coming backend development / software engineering roles

Tools: Learning the basic tools in R/Python, loading data of various types, reading data, plotting data

Communication: Learn to interpret results of algorithms/models, being able to talk to engineers, other ML folk and business. Explaining how to make figures. How to tell a story. When and what dataviz to use. Connect model metrics like AUC to impact metrics like revenue

Real data: Manipulating different file formats, working with “messy” data, trying to organize multiple data sets into one data set, pivots and joins know-how. Data Modeling skills. Several analysts and Kagglers are here

Supervised Projects: Work through from start to finish but with help and supervision, can clean easy data sets, but need a clear path from the beginning of the problem to the end scope/solution

Problem Formulation: How to define a question, how to turn a question into a statement about data, how to identify data sets that may be applicable, experimental design, critical thinking about data sets

Just the question: Here is a problem. Figure out a dataset, evaluation metric, when to quit, what counts as success and how to ship

The Novice: You can come up with your own questions and answer them using data and ship ML models
