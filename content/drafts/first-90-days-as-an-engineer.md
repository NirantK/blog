Aditya Ankur, asked me: 

**I know that there os a book for first 90 days as a executive. Is there something similar for programmers?**

I don't quite know of a book/essay which covers this yet sticks to the question. So I am writing one for him.

# The First 90 Days for a New Engineer

I expect each step to take roughly between 10 and 30 days, depending on the pace of your project + size of team. Do them in order i.e. 1 before 2, and 2 before 3. 

## 1. Study the Ecosystem

Get super comfy with all docs, codebases, APIs and **people** who work on those projects. 
Setup Zoom coffees at the very least. Shadow and track 2-3 recent support tickets to see how the on-call system works. And then, if possible, shadow someone for a week of on-call. Could be formal or volunteer to help. 

Ask what is important to people, and how they make decisions. Get a very nuanced understanding of what the team considers as "high quality" in that context. Note that you need to know team's perspective and not manager's. There can be some gap between the two often.

Sometimes it's scale, sometimes it's speed. There are usually at most 1-2 things which every engineering team does to their best.

## 2. Build relationships/Get Seen

Schedule a recurring 1-1 with your manager. Ask them to write down/describe explicit expectations from you. If they don't write, you write it down and email it to them -- and then follow up 90 days later.

Write notes for every meeting and share with right people.

For every repo/codebase that you study: Add comments, docstrings, setup instructions, make small improvements e.g. unit tests. Get seen by your senior engineering teammates. Not only your manager. 

These are the things and people who'll be able to help when you get stuck in a technical problem later. They'll know that you are not an incompetent prick, and have done your homework. This trust is cheap to earn and surprisingly sticky, when done early -- but hard to earn after first 90 days.

## 3. Quick _Loud_ Win

This is more for early career folk and less for senior folk. Do something which is a big, tricky, much talked about project and then do it fast. Doing it right is actually kind of less important. Why? Because no one expects early career people to get it right anyway. 

My hack for this has been to pick a project with some well understood technical risk. But! But! Pick where expectations are clear. For instance, towards the tail end of a big project which needs a small feature to be complete and closed.

If you can, pick a task which is closer to your technical strengths. E.g. I've done enough text classification in my short career that I can prototype one in 6-8 hours.

The point of quick "loud" wins is to ensure that you get a steady stream of projects to pick from -- forever. It's better for good projects to chase you,  and this is why this project needs to be loud. It will make you attractive to other managers/project owners. 

This is your momentum starter, your "pick up in a manner. And you don't get too many chances like this once you're old.

Not just quick. Quick _loud_ wins. 

# Beyond First 90 Days - 2 Less Obvious Ideas

I am assuming that you already know the hygiene factors: Make few promises. Keep most of them and exceed few of them atleast. Get to like the top 5% in the skill of effort estimation for your own work at the very least. And so on.

## Contribute to Developer Ecosystem

Improving any part of the developer ecosystem is useful and visible at the same time. For instance, let's say you add tests for a code path on which 10 developers are working. You've made the lives of 10 developers easier. They'll remember this when you come to them for help.

For some projects/teams, even the build time is quite large and error prone. Any improvements there also save a lot of contributor or developer time.

As Joel Spolsky (the person behind Stack Overflow) wrote: There is more than 1 way to help: 

* Maintaining an issue tracker
* Write a decent functional specification

You get the gist. Get creative and figure out points of leverage: low effort, high return on your time.

## Engineering Brand Efforts

You already know what are the 1-2 things your team's best is e.g. speed, scale, cadence, or software quality. 

Take those 2 topics and write down 5 reasons or points of evidence on why you think those are the 2 topics on which your team is best. For instance, if I was writing "speed" - one of my points would look like, we make 20 releases a week to almost 500K users. Or, we have fewer than 20 bugs for a release thanks to our amazing testing and QA friends. 

Now - expand these 5 points into a short, bullet point essay like this one. Ask your manager and other senior engineers for advice. You say something like, "Hey, I wrote down what our team does best - do you think I captured the essence and reasoning?"

Done? 

Great, now go write this as an internal and external blog. Submit this at a technical conference which cares about the dimension on which your team is the best. Bringing accolades to the team, with their blessings is much higher returns than reading 10 Medium blogs.

I hope these help when you join a new gig as an engineer. 

All the Best, 
Till we meet again,
