One of the most interesting shifts and paradigms of last 20-30 years in Indian elite circles was the acceptance for what I call high visibility hard work. For instance, some of the most popular enterpreneurs of today openly talk about hard it is.

This has few interesting outcomes: 
1. It helps people understand that there is a deep and personal cost to doing hard things e.g. enterpreneurship
2. It also summarily led to the rejection of "Passion hypothesis" i.e. that success comes from doing things you already like or are excited about
    - For the curious, the nuance is that you like doing things which you're are good at, and that keeps you excited/addicted. So the trick is to get so good at something, that no one can ignore you

Winning is now going to be talked about in terms of human values
