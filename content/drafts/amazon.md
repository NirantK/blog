This short page is my personal collection of lessons, ideas, observation, & notes. They mostly concern Bezos, with some love for Ambani as well.

I don't expect them to be useful for anyone except me, but hey - if you do, say Hi to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@NirantK)

## Mega-Tech of the Future

- ReCode Podcast - [How Jim Collins Helped Amazon Rescue Itself](https://player.fm/series/recode-decode-with-kara-swisher/how-good-to-great-author-jim-collins-helped-amazon-rescue-itself)
- [Peter Thiel tells Eric Schimdt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snMWgvMgWr4&feature=youtu.be) in 2012 that Amazon is the only mega-tech that knows how to invest in the future 
- [What is Amazon?](https://zackkanter.com/2019/03/13/what-is-amazon/) is an interesting essay from Zack Kanter which takes a stab at understanding what makes Amazon click, by contrasting it with Walmart

# Influential Sources

Where do ideas come from? I don't know. They are definitely not mine. I build on the work which I've studied and stewed in over several years. It's hard to point out all the relevant sources, but I mention the most "fresh" in my memory here. 

## Frameworks / Mental Models

These are meta-ideas that I rely to make a sense of things, specially organisations. 

- [Commandos, Infantry & Police](https://blog.codinghorror.com/commandos-infantry-and-police/)
  - Amazon is not a Corporation, it is a collection of specialized units ranging from commandos, infantry to police. They don't just conquer (as Snapchat did), or only cannabalize (as Facebook Inc. does), but they go all the way.
