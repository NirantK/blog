Bezos & Amazon Inc. 
---

This short page is my personal collection of lessons, ideas, observation, & notes. 

I don't expect them to be useful for anyone except me, but hey - if you do, say Hi to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@NirantK)

## Introductory

This is mostly obvious stuff. 
- Book - [The Everything Store](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B00DJ3ITKS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
- [Betting on Things that Never Change](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/betting-on-things-that-never-change/) by Morgan Housel

## Observations

These are nebulous ideas or dots. I don't know how they connect. 
- ReCode Podcast - [How Jim Collins Helped Amazon Rescue Itself](https://player.fm/series/recode-decode-with-kara-swisher/how-good-to-great-author-jim-collins-helped-amazon-rescue-itself)
- [Peter Thiel tells Eric Schimdt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snMWgvMgWr4&feature=youtu.be
) in 2012 that Amazon is the only mega-tech that knows how to invest in the future: 

[What is Amazon?](https://zackkanter.com/2019/03/13/what-is-amazon/) is an interesting essay from Zack Kanter which takes a stab at understanding what makes Amazon click, by contrasting it with Walmart

## Frameworks / Mental Models

These are meta-ideas that I rely to make a sense of things, specially organisations. 
- [Commandos, Infantry & Police](https://blog.codinghorror.com/commandos-infantry-and-police/)
  - Amazon is not a Corporation, it is a collection of specialized units ranging from commandos, infantry to police. They don't just conquer (as Snapchat did), or only cannabalize (as Facebook Inc. does), but they go all the way. 

Special thanks to [Abhinay Peddisetty](https://twitter.com/abh1nay) for inspiring this.
