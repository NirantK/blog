[About the word Torschlusspaniki](https://blogs.transparent.com/german/torschlusspanik/)

My previous workplaces made a serious dent in the size of my dreams. 
It is only at _welcoming meadow_ work culture at Verloop - that I've come to feel like going back on the chase. 

Psychological safety is a weird concept. I wish more leaders understood this intuitively.
