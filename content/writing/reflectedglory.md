```
ये जो लोग-बाग हैं, जंगल की आग हैं 
Ye jo log baag hain, Jungle ki aag hain
The people are like jungle fire

क्यूँ आग में जलूँ...
Kyun aag mein jalun
Why should I burn in the fire?

ये नाकाम प्यार में, खुश हैं ये हार में
Ye nakaam pyaar mein, Khush hai yeh haar mein
Defeated in love, they're happy in defeat


इन जैसा क्यूँ बनूँ...
Inn jaisa kyun banun
Why should I be like them?

# Identity

I am not going to wax poetic and speak in platitudes about identity, self, ego - the like and how the system is exploiting it. Frankly dear, I don't give a damn. 

I am here to tell you how to keep your identity small.

## Why should I keep my identity small?

[Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) explains how keeping your identity can be a competitive advantage:

> The most intriguing thing about this theory, if it's right, is that it explains not merely which kinds of discussions to avoid, but how to have better ideas. If people can't think clearly about anything that has become part of their identity, then all other things being equal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as possible.

1. If you know what is part of someone’s identity, you can avoid inflammatory discussions. This can be as simple as avoiding discussions about which shoe brand is the best?

2. The bigger advantage is this: Better ideas. The ability to think with lucidity, without biases is an unfair advantage. If you act on rational decisions without attacking someone's identity, it's an even bigger advantage which few can compete with.

## What do you mean by identity?

Identity, in the crudest sense are the words (and ideas) that you use to describe yourself - in your head. 
For instance, while you might be someone who build rocket ships, your identity might be "I am a `family man`". Or “I am a `craftsman engineer` making ships for space travel”

Here is a short mental exercise. Fill this blank with _at least_ 3 small phrases:

```
I am ___
```

Done?

Awesome.  Let's carry on: 

Here is what I came up with a few years ago: 

```
I am {Indian, guy, techie}
```

The labels in `{}` are (in the very crude sense) - my identity. Notice that these labels do not always have to be professional, personal or even _Truth_ in the strictest sense. 

They don't have to align with reality in any meaningful way. They simply describe how you perceive yourself. 

Want another example? Here is what a friend filled: 

```
I am {smart, get things done, make no excuses}
```

Not all parts of your identity are a disadvantage, in fact, some of them can be a form of advantage given a particular context. And you can stumble into those with some luck, but unlike Naval - I'm not here to create luck. I'm here to play the cards I'm dealt with. 


# **Don't bask in Reflected Glory**

That's it. That is the only thing I want you to do nothing and you will be on your way to learning **how do I avoid these labels**?

Reflected Glory is the invisible demon which will lead you to the butcher, chop you up into pieces, then slow barbecue you in open air. All this while you and the Demon, both laugh and make merry. 

Reflected glory is how Satan wins over honest, smart and hard working people. It is insidious. Sinister. Subtle. 

### In Political Discourse

> "People like us ... " - wait, go deeper and think. Your mental dialog will begin: "What does he mean by us? I am nobody. Why does a nobody matter? Is he using my emotions as a stepping stone to get where he wants to go?"

The politician is leveraging your mental acumen to fill in the gaps he left with what makes best sense for you, and most profit for him. Don't waste your energy on making rich people richer without getting something in return. 

But why does this trope work in the first place? Well, because somewhere in your identity - you allowed words like _India_, _American_, _Patriot_ or _Nationalist_ to creep in. 

Why did you allow them in the first place? Because there are actually positive connotations of being a part of the world's largest and most powerful democracy respectively. 

Stop. You walked into my trap. 

You just basked in the reflected glory of your ancestors. 

Both America and India are countries born of blood, sweat and tears. Not enough of which is yours. 
You haven't done anything _meaningfully large_ to contribute to democracy. 

You are basking in the reflected glory of your dead ancestors

Be grateful. Use them as your ideals
But don't bask in glory of your dead ancestors 

Do the work such that you can be proud
Do the work that when you meet your ideals, they can be proud

Keep your identity small

### In Casual Conversation 

> "Look at Michael, an Olympic athlete, I knew him in college" - wait, and think. 
> You might end up going this way: "Why is that relevant in this conversation? Is this an offer to make an intro to the Olympian, so that I improve my game? Or is this just banter-bragging? But why brag?"

Brag about achievements of someone you know. Or worked with. Or went to school with. 
Everyone around you looks at you for a brief moment of envy, or pride if they love you. 

They could have been proud of something you did. But instead they're proud that you know people who do things.
You are basking in the reflected glory of others.

The first time I internalised this perspective, I was deeply embarassed. 

Given that you've read this piece so far, I hope something for you. 
I hope that when you go to sleep tonight - you will sleep with the resolution to not bask in reflected glory of your friends and family. 

No matter how much you love them. You will be proud of them. But you will not bask in their glory. 
It's their spotlight and you will not even a light a candle to steal that. 

### In Professional Circles

Even in certain careers, labeling yourself can be a career limiting move:

> If you call yourself a programmer, someone is already working on a way to get you fired - from [Don't Call Yourself a Programmer](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/) by [@patio11](https://twitter.com/@patio11)

But why are people so deeply tempted to label themselves a programmer? 
Well, several reasons: programmer's have built amazing things, are respected for their craftsmanship and are generally smart people. 

Ironically, you only need this `programmer` label when you are actually none of the things which you admire in other programmers.
