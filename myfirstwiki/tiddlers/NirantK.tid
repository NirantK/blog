Hello, I'm Nirant. I go on the web as NirantK. 

I lead Machine Learning team at Verloop.io. I specialize in Natural Language Processing. In addition to writing a book about it, I shared a talk about it at ~PyCon 2019 as well. This year, Microsoft ~OpenAI solved the same use case with their GPT-3. 

My work has been recommended by Stanford and Github.com and appreciated by Nobel Laureate Dr. Paul Romer.
